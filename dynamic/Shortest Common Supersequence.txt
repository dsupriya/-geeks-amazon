Given two strings str1 and str2, find the length of the smallest string which has both, str1 and str2 as its sub-sequences.
Note: str1 and str2 can have both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.Each test case contains two space separated strings.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, output the length of the required string.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1<= |str1|, |str2| <= 100

Example:
Input:
2
abcd xycd
efgh jghi
